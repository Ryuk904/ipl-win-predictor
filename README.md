This project aims to predict the win percentage of IPL teams for each match, and also after every delivery, using machine learning techniques. The model is built to analyze various aspects of IPL matches, including team performance, player statistics, and game dynamics, to make accurate predictions in real-time.

Introduction
The IPL win prediction model uses historical match data and real-time delivery data to predict the likely outcome of a match. The project is designed to predict win percentages after each ball, providing a dynamic insight into the match's progress. Key features include:
-Win percentage prediction at any given point during a match.
-Real-time prediction after every ball based on ongoing data.

Technologies Used
-Python: Main programming language.
-Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
-NumPy: Numerical computing.
-Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms and models.
-Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization.
-Jupyter Notebooks: For interactive development.
